## üöÄ Features

- **Passenger Management**: Store and manage passenger details including their name, email, and phone number.
- **Train Information**: Record details about trains, including their type and name.
- **Booking System**: Create, track, and manage bookings seamlessly.
- **Schedules**: Handle train departure, arrival times, and associated stations.
- **Seats Management**: Track seat availability, class type, and assignments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Design

The database is designed using **MySQL** and follows a relational model with primary and foreign keys for entity relationships. Below is an overview of the entities and their relationships.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

### Key Entities:

1. **Passengers**:
   - `PassengerID` (Primary Key)
   - Name, Email, PhoneNumber

2. **Trains**:
   - `TrainID` (Primary Key)
   - TrainName, TrainType

3. **Bookings**:
   - `BookingID` (Primary Key)
   - BookingDate, BookingStatus, PassengerID (Foreign Key), TrainID (Foreign Key), ScheduleID (Foreign Key), SeatID (Foreign Key)

4. **Schedules**:
   - `ScheduleID` (Primary Key)
   - DepartureTime, ArrivalTime, Date, TrainID (Foreign Key), StationID (Foreign Key)

5. **Stations**:
   - `StationID` (Primary Key)
   - StationName, Location

6. **Seats**:
   - `SeatID` (Primary Key)
   - SeatNumber, ClassType, Availability, TrainID (Foreign Key)

7. **Payments**:
   - `PaymentID` (Primary Key)
   - BookingID (Foreign Key), Amount, PaymentDate, PaymentStatus

## üìö Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use the database:

1. **Add a New Passenger**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Passengers (Name, Email, PhoneNumber)
   VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '1234567890');
   ```

2. **Check Available Seats for a Train**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Seats
   WHERE TrainID = 1 AND Availability = 'Available';
   ```

3. **Retrieve Train Schedule by Station**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Schedules
   WHERE StationID = 3;
   ```
